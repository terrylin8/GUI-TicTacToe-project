# Tic Tac Toe

## For two players to play a set of games

This **Tic Tac Toe** game will create a game board for two users to play on.
For phase 1 of the project, this game will not show a graphic board, but texts only instead.
The reason for designing this game is that I am a board game enthusiast myself, 
and I *really* want to start learning how to make a board game of mine from the basic ones.
Tic Tac Toe then came to my mind as a starting point. 

##*User Stories*:
- As a user, I want to be able to add this match to a set of matches and see the scores
- As a user, I want to be able to set the icon of my piece
- As a user, I want to be able to set my username
- As a user, I want to be able to set how many matches to play in a set


- Idea for later on: adding more grid to expand the game into something like **Gobang** 
where you connect 5 pieeces in line to win
